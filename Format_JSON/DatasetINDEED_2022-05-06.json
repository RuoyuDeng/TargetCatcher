Our customers come to us for an inspiring work environment. As one of our receptionists, youll help deliver it. How? By providing sparkling service. Going the extra mile. And making sure everyone who visits us feels totally at home.\n\n\n A typical day at Spaces\n You arrive 15 minutes before your centre opens to make sure everything is ready to go. You make it your responsibility to order the first cappuccino of the day at the bar and make your round through the business club to make sure all lights are turned on and the place looks tidy.\n Slowly, the first members start to arrive and one of them asks you for the changed WiFi code. Afterwards, while digging through your emails, a guest walks in and says shes coming to provide training in one of the meeting rooms. You check the meeting room agenda and notice that almost all of the meeting rooms will be occupied today. You take her to the right meeting room, but you find out that our catering partner forgot to put coffee in the room and make sure that this is still done.\n A bit later, a member asks you if his mail has already arrived; hes expecting a really important letter. Later that morning, the mail comes in and you put it in the corresponding mailboxes  and send an email to the member that came by earlier, saying that his mail arrived and that its waiting for him in his mailbox.\n After a hectic morning, its time for lunch. You grab a homemade soup and a healthy salad together with your favourite colleagues in the restaurant.\n After lunch, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organisation of next weeks summer event. However, he mentions that one of the members just had a baby. You take it upon yourself to organise an act of kindness from Spaces, and to congratulate the parents of the new-born. Once youre done with ordering, a guest pops by to sign up for a membership. Because your Sales colleague isnt available right now, you help the guest with the online registration. Once the registration is done, you immediately hook her up with a badge (and immediately arrange one for the new employee on the 4th floor who just emailed you as well).\n At 6:00pm, its time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to wrap it up. Maybe they would like to join us for drinks at our weekly Friday drinks, or you direct them to that nice nearby restaurant you know so that they can grab a bite. Once the last people have left the building, and everythings left behind nice and tidy, you head home to enjoy your evening\n\n\n Bring your personality to work\n We look for people who are sociable and outgoing and who can bring their own style to our fun, thriving work environment.
